        Ezequiel, a multi-instrumentalist composer and arranger, began learning
        various instruments at age 12 and played in rock bands before moving to
        Switzerland in 2015. He studied at the Conservatoire Populaire de
        Musique, Danse et Théâtre of Geneva and earned Bachelor’s and Master’s
        degrees in contemporary music composition from the Hochschule der Künste
        Bern. He has been involved in various musical projects spanning
        contemporary, classical, tango, symphonic rock, bossa-nova, jazz,

        Mirko, a software engineer, also started his musical journey at age 12
        in the same workshop as Ezequiel. He has been DJing and producing
        electronic music since 2017, playing in his hometown and other cities in
        Argentina, and later continued in Barcelona, where he completed a sound
        technician course and a Master’s degree in architectural acoustics. At
        the beginning of 2020 he started making music remotely with Ezequiel
        from Barcelona, and two years later moved to Geneva, where they began to
        dedicate their full time to the project.{' '}
